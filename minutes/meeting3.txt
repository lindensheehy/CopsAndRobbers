next steps:
add amount of steps to win
start translating 
there are results online on different studies on how long it takes for cop to catch robber randomly moving, 

"(d,g) - cages" graph is what might require 3 cops. 
there is a theorem
if G has girth >= 5 then c(G) >= minimum degree in G,
Girth in graph is the length of the shortest cycle in the graph, so if the shortest 
length of a cycle in the graph is 5, then the vertex that has the smallest degree (ex 4) then the cop number is at least 4. So (d,g) cage is a graph where all verticies have degree d (exactly d) and the girth is g. 
so different variations of (d, g) cage is interesting so find like (d,5) cage has cop number at least d and it would be nice to find bigger cops.

and add the bus and train edges to the Scotland yard graph but for now no need tokens. 

also be sure to keep Scotland yard only with taxi, one with busses, one with busses and trains and taxi. - keep all versions.

Also very very far future step is figure out invisible robber.

something to think about (Not next step)
cop chooses a starting position, and robber choses - first starting position you see, but only every second move you see the position of the robber. This is the version that is super important - because in Scotland yard you DO see the robber but they tell you every 4 rounds or so. Maybe the graph has to change - like you see all POSSIBLE places robber could have been in.

We will have overleaf shared in a week or two and the references there can be used here publicly

Next meeting: Friday 20th at 10am maybe Thursday afternoon.
