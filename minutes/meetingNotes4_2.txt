for next meeting.
write references and info in overleaf,
make sure algorithms give the same time on finding shortest path. 


when there is one cop there should be generated a table - (see photos for info)
basically it is actually two tables - cops turn, robbers turn, where on y axis is cop, or x axis is robber, - basically 2 dynamic programming tables.
this is made to test there is no bug at the program 
so the two tables are populated during algorithm. You need to write number of rounds and where to play. It will be a winning strategy for cop.

for two cops it would tell you where to go instead of vizualizing. 

if the algorithm is way too slow the new stopping point would be to stop when we found the group we stop 
but again check reasoning if the first group we find is the best one

keep translating maybe even for testing cuz its faster

and again later we work on invisible robber.

when is the next time we meet?

Friday next week. 3pm. - might change.
